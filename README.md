# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a project built using NetBeans and MySQL, designed to efficiently manage library operations. It provides various features for managing library members, books, and the issuance and return of books.

## Features

The Library Management System offers the following functionalities:

1. **Library Member Management:** Easily add, delete, and modify library members, including staff and students. The system provides a user-friendly interface to manage member details such as contact information and membership status.

2. **Book Management:** Efficiently manage library books by adding, deleting, and modifying book records. Each book entry contains essential information like title, author, publication date, and availability status, ensuring an up-to-date book inventory.

3. **Issuance and Return of Books:** Streamline the process of book issuance and return for library members. The system checks book availability, updates the status, and records the issuance and due dates. Upon return, the system updates the book status and calculates any fines if applicable.

4. **Fine Calculation:** Enforce timely returns by calculating fines automatically if a book is not returned within the due date. The system calculates the fine amount based on predefined rules and adds it to the member's account, promoting accountability among library members.
